Creating Minimal Reproducible Example
#####################################

**Before requesting support, please also check** :ref:`Troubleshooting documentation page <Troubleshooting>`.

To help you debug the issue you have the fastest and most efficient please provide a Minimal Reproducible Example (**MRE**), docs on `how to create MRE here <https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example>`__.
This means everything, including **minimal script, required model .blobs, and any other assests**, should be compressed into single
file (zip/7z/tar) as the MRE. A few things to make sure before compressing files

#. That assets/model blobs are located at the right path.
#. Remove any unnecesary code: commented out code, and code that isn't relevant to the depthai/pipeline code (so host-side code).
#. Please provide **minimal code**. Main script should be as short as possible.

Besides MRE, please also provide the following information when you are requesting support:

* Name of the OAK camera (`all camera names here <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/>`__).
* The **Version of the deptahi** you are using. If it's not `the latest <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-core/releases>`__, please also try updating the depthai version to the latest (``python -mpip install depthai -U``).
* Screenshot of your pipeline using the `Pipeline Graph tool <https://github.com/geaxgx/depthai_pipeline_graph>`__.
* If you are using an OAK PoE device:

  * We suggest first checking the `PoE troubleshooting page <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/guides/getting-started-with-poe.html#poe-troubleshooting>`__.
  * **Bootloader version** you are using. You should have the latest bootloader version, see `OAK Device Manager <https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/bootloader/#device-manager>`__ for checking/updating the bootloader version.
