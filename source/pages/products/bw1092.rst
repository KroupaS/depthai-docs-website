The BW1092 is a modified version of the BW1098OBC with an added ESP32 System on Module (ESP32-WROOM-32). This board allows users to quickly prototype standalone embedded solutions. 

The ESP32 gives users access to a lightweight processor with useful features such as Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE), and WiFi, and comes in a convenient FCC/CE-certified module.

- PC to program ESP32. 

What's in the box?

Setup
*****
A number of examples that show how to communicate with the ESP32 over SPI can be found here:

https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments/tree/master/gen2-spi

All of these examples consist of two parts: An application that runs on the ESP32 and an application that runs on the MyriadX using the gen2 Pipeline Builder. More information can be found in that github's README.
